[2026-02-08T15:03:41.649Z]    Summary: Proved properties of $P_{min}(\binom{n}{k})$ for $n \le 50$. Published to proofs/exploration.md
[2026-02-08T15:03:41.649Z]    Details: Identified 7 exceptions for $n \le 50$: (7,3), (13,4), (14,4), (23,5), (44,8), (46,10), (47,11). Analyzed divisibility using Kummer's Theorem, showing that exceptions require $n$ to dominate $k$ digit-wise in all bases $p \le \max(n/k, k)$. Proposed a proof approach using the density of primes and digit constraints.

📊 Task erdos1094g-yy0 completed:
[2026-02-08T15:05:26.112Z]    Summary: Created 3 tasks: erdos1094g-i6l (explore), erdos1094g-3zy (verify), erdos1094g-wyg (formalize).
[2026-02-08T15:05:26.112Z]    Details: Gap Analysis: The main theorem is currently a single `sorry`. The existing literature (proofs/exploration.md) provides useful observations and a high-level approach but lacks a rigorous proof and precise bounds. I have identified the primary reference as Ecklund (1969), 'On the prime factorization of binomial coefficients'.

Strategy: I've initiated a bidirectional search by creating an explore task for a rigorous NL proof, a verify task for peer review, and a formalize task for the Lean skeleton. The formalizer is instructed to decompose the goal into lemmas matching the verified NL proof and may use citation sorrys (axioms) for standard results like Sylvester-Schur if needed.

Consistency Check: erdos1094g-cm0 was consistent with the explore role as it focused on natural language exploration and writing to proofs/. Next steps will focus on closing the forward-backward gap once the NL proof is verified.

📊 Task erdos1094g-i6l completed:
[2026-02-08T15:07:45.004Z]    Summary: Proved g(n, k) <= max(n/k, k) for n >= 2k with finite exceptions. Published to proofs/erdos1094.md
[2026-02-08T15:07:45.004Z]    Details: Confidence: High. The proof follows Ecklund (1969) by dividing the problem into two cases: n >= k^2 and 2k <= n < k^2. In the first case, we show g(n, k) <= k <= n/k using estimates on binomial coefficients and Kummer's Theorem. In the second case, the condition for g(n, k) > k is extremely restrictive on the base-p digits of n for all primes p <= k. A finite search (verified by Ecklund up to k=167) reveals exactly 7 exceptions: (7, 3), (13, 4), (14, 4), (23, 5), (44, 8), (46, 10), and (47, 11).
