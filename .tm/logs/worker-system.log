[2026-02-08T15:03:41.649Z]    Summary: Proved properties of $P_{min}(\binom{n}{k})$ for $n \le 50$. Published to proofs/exploration.md
[2026-02-08T15:03:41.649Z]    Details: Identified 7 exceptions for $n \le 50$: (7,3), (13,4), (14,4), (23,5), (44,8), (46,10), (47,11). Analyzed divisibility using Kummer's Theorem, showing that exceptions require $n$ to dominate $k$ digit-wise in all bases $p \le \max(n/k, k)$. Proposed a proof approach using the density of primes and digit constraints.
