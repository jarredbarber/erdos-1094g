The claim: for n ≥ 2k, the least prime factor of C(n,k) is ≤ max(n/k, k) with finitely many exceptions. Phase 1: Compute C(n,k) and its minimum prime factor for small values (n ≤ 50, k ≤ n/2). Identify ALL pairs where minFac(C(n,k)) > max(n/k, k). Phase 2: When does a prime p ≤ max(n/k, k) divide C(n,k)? Use Kummer's theorem. When p ≤ n/k, there should usually be carries in base p. Phase 3: Propose NL proof approach, identify Mathlib lemmas needed.

The existing literature (proofs/exploration.md) provides useful observations and a high-level approach but lacks a rigorous proof and precise bounds. I have identified the primary reference as Ecklund (1969), 'On the prime factorization of binomial coefficients'.\n\nStrategy: I've initiated a bidirectional search by creating an explore task for a rigorous NL proof, a verify task for peer review, and a formalize task for the Lean skeleton. The formalizer is instructed to decompose the goal into lemmas matching the verified NL proof and may use citation sorrys (axioms) for standard results like Sylvester-Schur if needed.\n\nConsistency Check: erdos1094g-cm0 was consistent with the explore role as it focused on natural language exploration and writing to proofs/. Next steps will focus on closing the forward-backward gap once the NL proof is verified."}

In the first case, we show g(n, k) <= k <= n/k using estimates on binomial coefficients and Kummer's Theorem. In the second case, the condition for g(n, k) > k is extremely restrictive on the base-p digits of n for all primes p <= k.
