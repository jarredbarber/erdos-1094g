{"id":"erdos1094g-cm0","title":"Explore: prime factorization structure of C(n,k) for small n,k","description":"Investigate Erdős 1094. The claim: for n ≥ 2k, the least prime factor of C(n,k) is ≤ max(n/k, k) with finitely many exceptions. Phase 1: Compute C(n,k) and its minimum prime factor for small values (n ≤ 50, k ≤ n/2). Identify ALL pairs where minFac(C(n,k)) > max(n/k, k). Phase 2: When does a prime p ≤ max(n/k, k) divide C(n,k)? Use Kummer's theorem. When p ≤ n/k, there should usually be carries in base p. Phase 3: Propose NL proof approach, identify Mathlib lemmas needed.

Analyzed divisibility using Kummer's Theorem, showing that exceptions require $n$ to dominate $k$ digit-wise in all bases $p \\le \\max(n/k, k)$. Proposed a proof approach using the density of primes and digit constraints."}
