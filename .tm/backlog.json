Identify ALL pairs where minFac(C(n,k)) > max(n/k, k). Phase 2: When does a prime p ≤ max(n/k, k) divide C(n,k)? Use Kummer's theorem. When p ≤ n/k, there should usually be carries in base p.

The formalizer is instructed to decompose the goal into lemmas matching the verified NL proof and may use citation sorrys (axioms) for standard results like Sylvester-Schur if needed.\n\nConsistency Check: erdos1094g-cm0 was consistent with the explore role as it focused on natural language exploration and writing to proofs/.
