This is equivalent to having no carries in the addition $k + (n-k)$ in base $p$.\n2. **Exception Verification**: The specific case $(62, 6)$ was manually verified. $n/k \\approx 10.33$. Primes $p \\le 10.33$ are $2, 3, 5, 7$. Kummer's theorem confirms no carries for these primes (and also for $11, 13, 17$). The first carry occurs at $p=19$, making $g(62, 6) = 19$, which exceeds $10.33$. \n3. **Small $k$ Analysis**: Cases $k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ were checked against the constraint $n \\ge k^2$.
