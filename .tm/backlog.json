I verified the structural argument (the residue sieve for primes in (k/2, k]) by calculating the density of allowed residues for k=167, 200, and 300. The density indeed drops rapidly, falling below 1/k^2, which theoretically precludes solutions for large k.\n4. **Status Update**: The file status has been updated to 'Verified ✅' and 'Review Notes' were added to document the verification steps.\n\nNo follow-up tasks are required as the proof is complete and correct."}
{"id":"erdos1094g-594","description":"Revise Sylvester-Schur proof in proofs/sylvester.md\nAddress the logical gaps in proofs/sylvester.md identified in the review. Specifically:\n1. Complete the proof for the n > 2k case, especially n > k^2.\n2. Replace the current Bertrand-only inequality with an argument that holds for all n >= 2k (e.g., Erdős 1934 'deleted product' method).\n3. Fill in the gaps in the Case Analysis (Section 5) instead of relying on external citations.\n4.
