**Metrics**: 
- Sorry count: 1
- Verified proofs: 0
- Task count: 2 (1 in_progress, 1 open)

**Status**: Initializing. Advisor needed to align task descriptions with role constraints.

**Observations**:
- Project is in early stage.
- `erdos1094g-cm0` (explore) is confused by a "Compute" instruction that conflicts with its "NEVER write code" role constraint.
- `PROBLEM.md` exists (case-sensitive issue in my first check).

**Actions**:
- Created advisor task `erdos1094g-yy0` to perform gap analysis and resolve task/role conflicts.

**Watch next**:
- Advisor response to the role conflict.
- Progress in `proofs/` directory.
