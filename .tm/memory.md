**Metrics**: 
- Sorry count: 16 (Sylvester: 4, Ecklund: 12)
- Verified proofs: 7
- Task count: 2 open, 1 in_progress, 38 closed

**Status**: Phase 3: Formalizing New Proofs. Cleaning up Sylvester and Ecklund.

**Observations**:
- `erdos1094g-mcp` finished but left syntax errors and holes in `Erdos/Sylvester.lean`.
- `erdos1094g-c28` is making progress on `Erdos/EcklundCase1.lean` (active for 11m).
- `erdos1094g-zvo` is waiting.

**Actions**:
- Created `erdos1094g-qhc` to fix `Erdos/Sylvester.lean`.

**Watch next**:
- Completion of `c28` and `qhc`.
- Once Sylvester is clean, `erdos1094g-z8n` (the main task) can be considered truly done (even though it's marked closed).
