**Metrics**: 
- Sorry count: 4 (Ecklund: 1, Sylvester: 3)
- Verified proofs: 7
- Task count: 4 open, 1 in_progress, 46 closed

**Status**: Deep in the weeds of Ecklund/Sylvester formalization.

**Observations**:
- `erdos1094g-zvo` (Ecklund) has successfully closed finite checks for $k=3..7$ using `CheckFact.lean`! Only $k \ge 8$ remains (infinite case).
- `Erdos/Sylvester.lean` has 3 technical sorries (lines 198, 200, 372).
- Explore tasks (`8st`, `oqb`) are open to replace major axioms (`prime_gap_lemma`, `ees_large_k`).
- `4n7` is open to prove Sylvester axioms (`large_k_inequality`, `small_k_cases`).

**Actions**:
- Monitored `zvo`. It's tackling the general $k \ge 8$ case or deciding to axiomize it.
- No new interventions needed. System is busy.

**Watch next**:
- `zvo` completion.
- Progress on Sylvester cleanups (`5ta`) and axioms (`4n7`).
