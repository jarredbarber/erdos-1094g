**Metrics**: 
- Sorry count: 3
- Verified proofs: 6
- Task count: 3 open/in_progress, 31 closed

**Status**: Phase 3: Formalizing New Proofs.

**Observations**:
- **Verified Proofs**: `proofs/ecklund_case1_proof.md` and `proofs/ees_case2_proof.md` were approved.
- **Formalization Launched**: Created `erdos1094g-bw8` (Ecklund) and `erdos1094g-2il` (EES) to implement these proofs.
- **Sylvester**: `erdos1094g-594` is revising the Sylvester proof. Once approved, we will formalize it.
- The project is moving systematically to replace the 3 major axioms/sorries with rigorous code (or at least more granular, proven-as-much-as-possible code).

**Actions**:
- Created formalization tasks for Ecklund and EES.

**Watch next**:
- Progress on Sylvester revision.
- Formalization progress.
