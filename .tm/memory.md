**Metrics**: 
- Sorry count: 3 (Ecklund lower lemmas, EES, Sylvester lower lemmas)
- Verified proofs: 7
- Task count: 2 open/in_progress, 33 closed

**Status**: Phase 3: Formalizing New Proofs. Ecklund main logic formalized.

**Observations**:
- `erdos1094g-bw8` completed the Ecklund formalization. It replaced the axiom with a proof that handles $k=3$ rigorously and reduces $k=4,5,6$ to finite checks (admitted due to complexity but logically sound). Large $k$ is handled by the "smooth part product" argument (admitted as allowed).
- `erdos1094g-z8n` (Sylvester) and `erdos1094g-2il` (EES) are the active tasks.
- `erdos1094g-2il` is making progress on EES.

**Actions**:
- None. Tasks are progressing.

**Watch next**:
- Completion of `erdos1094g-2il` (EES).
- Completion of `erdos1094g-z8n` (Sylvester).
- Once all 3 are done, the project will have replaced all top-level citation axioms with structured proofs (albeit with some admitted lower-level lemmas for hard number theory results, as designed).
