**Metrics**: 
- Sorry count: 3 (Sylvester axiom, Ecklund k>=3 sorry, EES k>=29 sorry)
- Verified proofs: 4 (Old citation proofs) -> 3 new proofs pending verification
- Task count: 3 verify tasks open

**Status**: Transitioning from Citation Axioms to First Principles. Verify tasks launched.

**Observations**:
- User poked about sorries/axioms. Responded by launching verification for the replacement proofs.
- The project started with citation axioms to build a working skeleton (good practice).
- `erdos1094g-f49` (Sylvester), `erdos1094g-t6i` (Ecklund), `erdos1094g-eqh` (EES) have just completed their exploration tasks, providing rigorous NL proofs to replace the axioms.
- Created verify tasks `erdos1094g-aja`, `erdos1094g-9s8`, `erdos1094g-3kh` to review these new proofs.
- Once verified, we will create formalize tasks to remove the axioms/sorries.

**Actions**:
- Created 3 verify tasks for the new rigorous proofs.

**Watch next**:
- Completion of verify tasks.
- Creation of formalize tasks to close the 3 remaining holes using the new proofs.
