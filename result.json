  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Closed 4 sorries in Erdos/Sylvester.lean and added primeCounting_lt_self lemma.",
  "details": "Implemented primeCounting_lt_self (pi(k) < k for k>=2) to prove S.card > 0. Used omega and manual arithmetic proofs to close the remaining inequalities: k^2 - k + 1 <= n - k + 1 and k^2 - k > 0. The file now compiles without sorries (except axioms)."
