  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Formalized and proved the Deleted Product Lemma in Erdos/Sylvester.lean. Corrected the statement to include the necessary smoothness assumption.",
  "details": "Replaced the `axiom deleted_product_lemma` with a `theorem` and provided a proof. The proof uses the property that the number of multiples of p^j in an interval of length k is at most k/p^j + 1, and that removing the maximal valuation element ensures the remaining count is at most k/p^j. Updated `sylvester_schur_theorem` to use the corrected lemma by deriving the smoothness condition from the contradiction hypothesis."
