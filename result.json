  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Closed the gap for 300 <= k < 60184 using computational verification and analytic bounds.",
  "details": "1. Modified Erdos/EESAnalytic.lean to support k >= 15000 (verified constants via Python). 2. Created Erdos/EESGap.lean with chunked native_decide proofs for 300 <= k < 15000. 3. Updated Erdos/EES1974.lean to split the proof range and use the new components."
